MoST Scenario is meant to be used with SUMO (Simulator of Urban MObility).
* Version 0.1 has been tested with [SUMO 0.32.0](https://github.com/eclipse/sumo/tree/v0_32_0).
* For the following commits is necessary to use (at least) [Eclipse SUMO Version 267588bdfc](https://github.com/eclipse/sumo) due to the major improvements they made to the public transport system.

Please refer to the [SUMO wiki](http://sumo.dlr.de/wiki/Simulation_of_Urban_MObility_-_Wiki) for further information on the simulator itself.

#### How To:
MoST Scenario can be lunched directly with its configuration file.
* `sumo -c most.sumocfg` or `run.sh` from the _scenario_ folder.

To use the scrips in the `tools` directory it's necessary to exec `source setenv.sh`.

Additional mobility can be generated using
* `mobility.generator.sh` from the _tools/mobility_ folder.

#### Files:
* `scenario` is the ready-to-use scenario
* `tools/mobility` contains the files required to generate various traffic demands.
* `tools/pypml` contains the parking mornitor library, still 'work in progess'.
* `tools/static` contains the raw OSM-like file, scripts, and configuration files to regenerate the scenario from the beginning.

Note: the configuration files contained in `tools/static/typemap` are a slightly modified version of a subset of the SUMO files availavle at https://github.com/eclipse/sumo/tree/master/data/typemap.
