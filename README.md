## Monaco SUMO Traffic (MoST) Scenario

MoST Scenario is meant to be used with SUMO (Simulator of Urban MObility).
* Version 0.3 has been tested with [SUMO 1.0](https://github.com/eclipse/sumo/tree/v1_0_0).
* Due to [Issue #4518](https://github.com/eclipse/sumo/issues/4518) it requires the development
  version of [SUMO](https://github.com/eclipse/sumo.git) in order to use multi-threading.

Please refer to the [SUMO wiki](http://sumo.dlr.de/wiki/Simulation_of_Urban_MObility_-_Wiki) for further information on the simulator itself.

### How To:
MoST Scenario can be lunched directly with its configuration file.
* `sumo -c most.sumocfg` or `run.sh` from the _scenario_ folder.

To use the scrips in the `tools` directory it's necessary to exec `source setenv.sh`.
#### See [Scenario re-genration](https://github.com/lcodeca/MoSTScenario/wiki/How-to-rebuild-the-scenario.)

#### Files:
* `scenario` is the ready-to-use scenario
* `tools/mobility` contains the files required to generate various traffic demands.
* `tools/parkings` contains the an example of parking mornitoring done with [PyPML](https://github.com/lcodeca/PyPML).
* `tools/static` contains the raw OSM-like file, scripts, and configuration files to regenerate the scenario from the beginning.

Note: the configuration files contained in `tools/static/typemap` are a slightly modified version of a subset of the SUMO files available at https://github.com/eclipse/sumo/tree/master/data/typemap.
