## Mobility Generator

#### How to use it:
1) In [intermodal.mobilitygen.json](https://github.com/lcodeca/MoSTScenario/blob/master/tools/mobility/intermodal.mobilitygen.json) change the absolute path for `baseDir`, `outputPrefix`, and `sumocfg` to reflect the location of your MoSTScenario folder.
2) Run it with `python3 intermodal.mobilitygen.py -c most.intermodal.mobilitygen.json`

NOTE: this tool is in its early stages, given that variables names and behaviour are changing constantly, I'm not updating a list of variables=meaning. The names are self-explanatory for the moment.
